In this project, my responsibility was to develop a system integrating both frontend and backend components. Utilizing Java Spring Boot and MySQL, I constructed a solid backend framework, while employing React for the frontend to ensure a responsive and engaging user interface. The core objective of this project was to facilitate efficient management within a business context, incorporating modules for employees, clients and their projects, team leaders responsible for guiding teams, and a CEO who oversees the entire organizational operations.
