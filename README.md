  In this project, we were required to implement a system that utilizes both the frontend and the backend aspects. On the backend side, we used Java Spring Boot and MySQL for the database, while on the frontend, we employed React. The project is fundamentally about managing a business that includes employees, clients with projects, team leaders who oversee the teams, and a CEO who manages the entire company.
